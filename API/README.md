This includes a PowerShell script to initiate a few API calls for different tasks within QRadar administration. This Script expects local directories be created, a QRadar IP be assigned, and an Auth Token be created for this script. 
The Log Sources function also assumes you have created a Module in your personal workbook for the QRadar_API_Metrics macro.
